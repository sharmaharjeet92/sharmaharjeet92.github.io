## <a href="https://github.com/sharmaharjeet92/scripts/tree/master/Header_Order" class="btn btn-success">Header Order</a>
This small project came to picture when lastest version of Curl(curl 7.65.2) started messing up with the header order. Sometimes the Host header is present at first and sometime in middle. Due to such behaviour,some of our tests on WAF were not working. This projects represents a GUI version of Python Requests modules using Flask. It is useful in cases where you want to test specific web configuration by sending HTTP requests in certain orders.
