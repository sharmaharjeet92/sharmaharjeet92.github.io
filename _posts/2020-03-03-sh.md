Information Security is an entire universe in itself and there is always new to learn every day. As I have made a promise with myself to document my learning, this article is a continuous effort towards that. In today's article, I will go through the basics of server hardening and will try to establish a basic understanding of the core components of this concept.In the later part of this article,we will discuss about how you can automate the process of Server Hardening and create a pipeline which automatically scan,audit new operating system images,patch them , install necessarry logging systems and bake Golden AMIs. 


Let's start with the term "Hardening", what exactly we mean by it, in generic terms, Hardening is something where we take the soft material/components and then made few changes in it in such a way that the end product of material/component is more stronger and more resistant to the damages. That's exactly what server hardening is!  In simple technical terms, we take a base/vanilla operating system/software/configuration component then make changes to its configurations in such a way that the end product is more resistant to the attacks and has better detection/mitigation capabilities in it.

Now equip the definition of hardening, let's establish what exactly we are going to harden when we say server hardening. Server hardening in itself is a vague term, right? A typical server hardening consists of below core components:
###
    1. Patch Management.
    2. Turning off unnecessary services.
    3. Disabling unnecessary user accounts and setting password policies.
    4. Configuring and installing the detection components.
    5. Setting up pipelines to send logs generated by the system, IDS, AVs to a centralized location.
    6. Defining the roles and responsibilities for security maintenance of servers.
    
 Now as we have established the *"What"* part of the article,lets move to the second part which is *"Why"* it is necessary and why companies,governments pay close attention to Server Hardening?
