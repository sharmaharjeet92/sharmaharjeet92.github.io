Subdomain takeovers are quite common these days and as **Frans Ros√©n** rightly said in his  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhJv8CU-RIk">talk</a> that SubDomain takeovers are modern day XSS. Companies spends thousands of dollars to buy shiny new tools and suddenly a bug report from bounty hunters made us realize that how a small misconfiguration can cause harm to a company's reputation or assests. While you will get a lot of articles on how to verify if a website subdomain takeover is vulnerable to subdomain takeovers there were very less articles from a blueteam/soc/threat-hunting prospectives. This post is a tiny effort to add something in the later(BlueTeam) section. Most of the content that I will be discussing here is a fusion of great series of posts done by <a href="https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-basics/">Patrick Hudak</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/Guide-Subdomain-Takeovers">HackerOne</a> and <a href="https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/">Detectify</a>. I have just tried to organize my understanding of subdomain takeover topic in this blog post. Hopefully it will help someone connecting the dots while they are in the process of understanding subdomain takeover topic.
